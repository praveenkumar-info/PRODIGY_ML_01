# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains the code and data for a simple house price prediction model using linear regression. The dataset used for this model is the USA Housing dataset, which includes information about various housing attributes in the United States.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Load the data using the provided Jupyter notebook.
* Preprocess the data as necessary.
* Train the linear regression model using the preprocessed data.
* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
# Data
**The USA Housing dataset includes the following features:**

* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
* 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
* 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
* 'Price': Price that the house sold at
* 'Address': Address for the house

# Model
The model used for this project is linear regression, which is a simple and widely used supervised learning algorithm for regression problems. The model is trained using the preprocessed data, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

# Results
The performance of the linear regression model is reported in the Jupyter notebook. The MSE and R-squared values are used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple house price prediction model using linear regression and the USA Housing dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and there is room for improvement by implementing more advanced techniques such as feature engineering, regularization, or using a more complex model.
